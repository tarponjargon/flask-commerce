              Only you or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a
              verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. However,
              you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor
              child.

            <p>
              Unfortunately, we cannot respond to your request or provide you with
              personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
              the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.
              Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an
              account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a
              verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority
              to make the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its
              receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and
              extension time period (up to 90 days). If you have an account with us, we
              will deliver our response to that account. If you do not have an account
              with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically, at your
              option. The response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot
              comply with a request, if applicable.

              <strong><a href="/ca-do-not-sell">please fill out this form</a></strong>. If exercised, the decision to opt-out will be
              valid for 12 months, at which time we may request that you authorize the
              sale of personal information again.
